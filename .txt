* Need to setup the code StudentDetails button to popup like the edit button and displays just the student name, grade, birthday, and school information

* Extra Features
----> Still need to add graphs/charts to display overall attendance
----> Mark Attendance needs to be setup still
----> Reports will pull up Students attended this month per grade, and what school they come from
----> ----> The purpose of the reports tab is to add insights for the school to make recruiting decisions and where they should extend their marketing efforts
----> Dashboard will just give a brief summary of current attendance for the week and month (we can probably just link that in from the reports tab)
----> ----> It will also provide alerts regarding due dates for attendance records to be sent in
----> Fetch attendance should only display students who were present not both absent and present
----> Need to clean up the View Attendance UI
----> What if we want to search the student by name and we only include the first name and not the last name? (creating a fuzzy search)
